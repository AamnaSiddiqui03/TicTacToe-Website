TIC TAC TOE GAME:

During the development of my Tic Tac Toe game, I gained valuable experience in front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to create an interactive and engaging user interface, implement game logic and mechanics, and incorporate audio elements into a web application. Through this project, I enhanced my problem-solving skills, honed my programming abilities, and gained a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of web development. I am proud of the final result, and it has motivated me to continue learning and exploring new possibilities in web development.
